# quickarchconfiguration
my arch basic configuration ,when install a new  arch on my machine
vim/neovim configuration are included
and tips to use git on my machine
this all for a quick configuration
however my honor magicbook16 does not fit this system 
several times when i try to apply arch linux 
some warnings like :missing linux-firmware like  modules : wd719x qed bfa aic994xx qla1280 qia2xxx xhci_pci 
when these errors occur, ican not reboot my machine and completely close it . that annoy me a lot 
while in manjaro these errors occur again ,
i found that when my kernel is above 5.15 or higher  , these errors occur
but i use ubuntu it use kernel 5.13.0  ,it run well 


i think it is better when i buy a new machine which  has better drivers to match linux well 
now i use arch and dppein in vbox 
i find that i'm totally immersed in linux and its operating mode
