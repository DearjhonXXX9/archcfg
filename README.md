# quickarchconfiguration

l love arch , but my machine doesn`t support it.
Several times when i install arch on my machine,it has kernel above 5.15 , something odd occured,
it can`t reboot and poweroff ,or i will take me about 2 minutes to reboot it .yeah i timed it several times, 2 minutes.

i love arch ,but i am passive ,i need wine to install qq  ,however it works not well

so now i use deepin ,its wine perfectly run qq
and grand search improve my efficiency greatly

deepin linux 
hope it a better future
